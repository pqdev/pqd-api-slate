# Introduction

Welcome to the ProQuest Dialog API! You can use our API to search for content, access content, and manage alerts on our platform.

# Authentication

The ProQuest Dialog API uses bearer tokens to allow access. Please contact ProQuest Dialog directly in order to obtain a bearer token for API access.

The ProQuest Dialog API expects a bearer token to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer pqdtoken`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>pqdtoken</code> with the bearer token provided to you.
